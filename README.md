An Experimental Design : Soda Displacement Using Mentos Candies
The goal of this experiment was to observe how mentos reacts with soda in different situations.
For our experiment we decided to do a 3-factor experiment consisting of the number of mentos level (2,4), type of soda (Coca Cola, Diet Coke) and temperature (refrigerated/non-refrigerated).

Analyses Done: ANOVA, Normality and Homogeneity of Variance Checking, Tukey Tests, Interaction Plots, Contrasts for Interactions, Best Set Conditions Test and Scheffe Test
